Closed Range Operator

The closed range operator (a...b) defines a range that runs from a to b, and includes the values a and b. The value of a must not be greater than b.

The closed range operator is useful when iterating over a range in which you want all of the values to be used, such as with a for-in loop:

for index in 1...5 {
    print("\(index) times 5 is \(index * 5)")
}



Half-Open Range Operator

The half-open range operator (a..<b) defines a range that runs from a to b, but does not include b. It is said to be 
half-open because it contains its first value, but not its final value. As with the closed range operator, the value of
a must not be greater than b. If the value of a is equal to b, then the resulting range will be empty.

Half-open ranges are particularly useful when you work with zero-based lists such as arrays, where it is useful to count
up to (but not including) the length of the list:

let names = ["Anna", "Alex", "Brian", "Jack"]
let count = names.count
for i in 0..<count {
    print("Person \(i + 1) is called \(names[i])")
}



One-Sided Ranges

The closed range operator has an alternate form for ranges that continue as far as possible in one direction—for example,
a range that includes all the elements of an array, from index 2 to the end of the array. In these cases, you can omit 
the value from one side of the range operator. This kind of range is called a one-sided range because the operator has a 
value on only one side. 

For example:

for name in names[2...] {
    print(name)
}
// Brian
// Jack
 
for name in names[...2] {
    print(name)
}
// Anna
// Alex
// Brian

The half-open range operator also has a one-sided form that’s written with only its final value. Just like when you include a value on both sides, the final value isn’t part of the range. For example:

for name in names[..<2] {
    print(name)
}
// Anna
// Alex
